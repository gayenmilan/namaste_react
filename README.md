# React Hooks
- React hooks is normal JS function with some super power
- useState() & useEffect() are the most used 2 hooks
- useState() & useEffect() we have to import as nammed import
- useState() we will use to create state variable inside a component | const[listofrest, setlistofrest] = useState([]); is the syntax to create state variable. | In useState variable we have to pass 2 argument [listofrest, setlistofrest], first one will contain the initial value and the secod one will update the first one whenever there is any changes in data. | Whenever the value of state variable changes react will re render the UI as per new data.
